# Game Development Plan

## Brain Storming: 
	-Game Idea / Story / Plot
	-Features
	-Content
	-Mechanics needed (Inventory, Weapons, Enemy AI etc...)
	-Art Style
	-Timeline of all features/content/mechanics in order of when it should be added
	-Milestones (big / small)
	-Status updates
	-Target Platforms
	-Where will it be released

## Create Assets:
	UI
	Models (3D) / Sprites (2D)
	Main Menu Artwork (If needed)
	Music / SFX


## Project Start:
	-Set up Enviroment(Engine / Enviroment of choice)
	-Import Assets
	-Basic Layouts (of scenes)
	-Start Coding basic features / mechanics


## Project Continue:
	-Impliment next feature/content/mechanic (see Time Line for next thing to add)


 
## Playable Demo:
	-Optional 
	-As defined in Brainstorming phase

## Pre-Release: 
	-Social media posts -> build anticipation
	-Media Package 
	-Try to get the word out about the game

## Release: 
	-Release to chosen platforms

## Updates: 
	-Bug fixes as needed
	-New content as needed

  # Definitions
  
  
  ## Game Idea: 	
	-Consists of the games story or plot. 
	-Explains why the player is in the situation they are in, and their goals

## Features: 
	-What special abilities will (character/npc/enemy) have
	-What interactive things will be included (puzzles/hidden items/chests...)

## Content: 
	-What art will be needed (Includes models, sprites, music, sfx, post processing, particles)

## Mechanics Needed: 
	-Code focused
	-What scripts/systems will be needed to accomidate the games features and content
		(Save System, Inventory, Shooting Mechanic...)

## Art Style: 
	-How will the game look and feel
	-2D or 3D
	-Audio
	-Post Processing


## Timeline: 	
	-Dictates what will be added to the game next (the order the game will be built in)
	-Also when things will be added to the game (hence the name "Timeline")
	

## Milestones: 
	-Big addition to the game

## Status updates: 
	-Little addition to the game 

## Testing: 
	-Test of new features (code)
	-Make sure all code/systems work with other code / systems
	-This is where changes/updates to game idea/content/mechanics can happen


## Media: 
	-Social media posts
	-Devlogs
	-As directed by Milestones/Status updates
